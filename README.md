# MCTS-UCT Demo

A MCTS-UCT agent in JavaScript for Connect 4

The game represents a "Board" state as an array of 6 sub-arrays, length 7, with each sub-array representing a Row, from top to bottom, of a 6x7 (Height x Width or Row X Column) Board.

Plays an entire game of Connect 4, printing each new Board with simulation results per turn, then outputs the winner (Player 1 or Player 2).
